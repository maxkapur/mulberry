# Mulberry

â€¦ is a college application strategist. The user interface is at 
[maxkapur.com/mulberry/](https://maxkapur.com/mulberry/).

You input estimates of your admissions chances at each school and 
the amount of utility you associate with going there, 
and Mulberry sorts the schools in the order you should apply
to them to maximize your expected utility.

The underlying algorithm is described in my
[MS thesis](https://github.com/maxkapur/CollegeApplication).
