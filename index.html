        <!-- <h2>Introduction</h2> -->

        <p>
            Applying to college is kinda hard. You have to figure out which schools you like,
            and you also have to figure out which schools you actually have a good chance of
            getting into. That‚Äôs the <strong>information-gathering problem.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            And once you have this information, it‚Äôs tough to decide how best to allocate
            your limited applications across desirable, competitive ‚Äúreach schools‚Äù
            and less attractive ‚Äúsafety schools‚Äù where admissions is a safer bet.
            That‚Äôs the <strong>strategic problem.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            There are boatloads of ‚Äúchance me!‚Äù websites that can help you with
            the information-gathering problem. But when it comes to the strategic problem,
            research shows that people often resort to folk wisdom, risk-averse heuristics, and gut feelings.
            <strong>Mulberry treats the strategic problem as a math problem.</strong> It 
            complements the introspective techniques above by offering dispassionate,
            numbers-driven advice.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Mulberry is an algorithm.</strong> You input estimates of your admissions
            chances at each school and the amount of utility you associate with going there,
            and Mulberry sorts the schools in the order you should apply
            to them in order to maximize your expected utility. <a href="#what-is-utility">(‚ÄúUtility‚Äù?)</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            We‚Äôve randomly generated a few colleges to get you started. 
        </p>

        <div class="interface-container">
            <ul id="school-input-area">
                <li class="school-entry-row">
                    <label class="school-entry-header">üè´ School name</label>
                    <label class="school-entry-header">üé≤ Admissions probability</label>
                    <label class="school-entry-header">üí∞ Utility value</label>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <div class="add-remove-school">
                <button id="add-school-button" onclick="addCollegeEntry()">‚ûï Add a school</button>
                <button id="remove-school-button" onclick="removeCollegeEntry()">‚ûñ Remove a school</button>
            </div>

            <div id="calculate-button-wrapper">
                <button type="submit" onclick="calculate()">ü™Ñ Calculate application order</button>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <div id="results-area-wrapper">
            <p id="results-intro-text">‚Ä¶ will appear here.</p>
            <ol id="results-area">
            </ol>
            <p id="results-outro-text" hidden>
                If you can only apply to <em>n</em> schools, you should apply to schools
                1 through <em>n</em> above, and your expected utility will be that listed
                in the <em>n</em>th row.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>How does the algorithm work?</h2>
        <p>
            Your goal, in applying to college, is (probably) to maximize the utility of
            the <em>best</em> school you get into. If you apply to just one school, then
            your expected utility is the admissions probability times the utility value.
            But if you apply to many schools, your expected utility is a conditional
            expression that depends on whether you get into your first choice, your second
            choice, and so on.
        </p>

        <p>
            It turns out that <strong>the optimal application strategy can be characterized
            by a certain permutation (ordering) of the schools.</strong>
            If you can only apply to one college, you should apply to the first school
            in that permutation; if you can apply to two colleges, you should apply to
            the first two, and so on. Mulberry takes your admissions probabilities
            and utility parameters and computes this permutation.
        </p>

        <h2 id="what-is-utility">How do I determine my utility values?</h2>

        <p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility">Utility</a> is an economic
            concept that involves assigning numbers to how much you value things.
            Even though people can‚Äôt always <em>say</em> what price they place on
            something, sometimes they <em>reveal</em> it by, for example, canceling their
            Netflix subscription after a price increase.
        </p>

        <p>
            College preferability is multidimensional: Some schools offer an exciting
            student experience; others, better job prospects. Everyone views the tradeoff
            among these factors differently. But the utility value is meant to
            summarize, in a single number, <strong>how much <em>you</em> like each school
            in light of your own priorities and values.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            A good way to estimate the utility of the schools you are considering
            is to ask yourself the following question:
            <strong>
                If letters of admission to this college were sold
                at 7/11, how much money would I be willing to pay for one?
            </strong>
            Then divide your answer by some constant so you can
            fit it in the scale above.
        </p>

        <p>
            The underlying algorithm is described in my
            <a href="https://github.com/maxkapur/CollegeApplication">MS thesis</a>. 
            My thesis also deals with a more general form of the problem in which colleges
            have different application <em>fees</em> and you have a finite <em>budget</em>
            to spend on applications. If you want to solve general instances, check out
