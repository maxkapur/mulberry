        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
            Applying to college is kinda hard. You have to figure out which schools you like,
            and you also have to figure out which schools you actually have a good chance of
            getting into. That‚Äôs <strong>problem 1.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            Even if you have this information, it is tough to decide how best to allocate
            your limited applications across ‚Äúreach schools‚Äù (which are hard to get into
            but highly desirable) and ‚Äúsafety schools‚Äù (which are easier to get into but
            not as attractive). That‚Äôs <strong>problem 2.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            There‚Äôs an overwhelming number of ‚Äúchance me!‚Äù websites that can help you with
            problem 1. But when it comes to problem 2, people tend to resort to folk wisdom,
            risk-averse heuristics, and gut feelings. It‚Äôs not wrong to consult these sources.
            But Mulberry helps give you an objective view of <strong>problem 2.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            You input estimates of your admissions chances at each school and
            the amount of utility you associate with going there,
            and Mulberry sorts the schools in the order you should apply
            to them in order to maximize your expected utility.
        </p>

        <p>
            We‚Äôve randomly generated a few colleges to get you started. 
        </p>

        <div class="add-remove-school">
            <button id="add-school-button" onclick="addCollegeEntry()">‚ûï Add a school</button>
            <button id="remove-school-button" onclick="removeCollegeEntry()">‚ûñ Remove a school</button>
        </div>

        <ul id="school-input-area">
            <li class="school-entry-row">
                <label class="school-entry-header">üè´ School name</label>
                <label class="school-entry-header">üé≤ Admissions probability</label>
                <label class="school-entry-header">üí∞ Utility value</label>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div id="calculate-button-wrapper">
            <button type="submit" onclick="calculate()">ü™Ñ Calculate application order</button>
        </div>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <div id="results-area-wrapper">
            <p id="results-intro-text">‚Ä¶ will appear here.</p>
            <ol id="results-area">
            </ol>
        </div>

        <h2>How should I determine my utility values?</h2>

        <p>
            College preferability isn‚Äôt exactly a linear thing‚Äîsome schools might
            offer a better student experience, whereas others might offer better job
            prospects. It‚Äôs up to you to decide how to trade off these various factors.
        </p>

        <p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility">Utility</a> is an economic
            concept that involves assigning numbers to how much you value things.
            Even though people can‚Äôt always <em>say</em> what price they place on
            something, sometimes they <em>reveal</em> it by, for example, canceling their
            Netflix subscription after a certain price increase.
        </p>

        <p>
            One way to get a utility estimate for the schools you are considering
            is by answering the following question: <em>If a letter of admission to
                this college went up for auction, how much money would I be willing
                to pay for it?</em> Then divide your answer by some constant so you can
            fit it in the scale above.
        </p>

        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>
            Your goal, in applying to college, is (probably) to maximize the utility of
            the <em>best</em> school you get into. If you apply to just one school, then
            your expected utility is the admissions probability times the utility value.
            But if you apply to many schools, your expected utility is a conditional
            expression that depends on whether you get into your first choice, your second
            choice, and so on.
        </p>

        <p>
            It turns out that the optimal application strategy, under these assumptions, 
            can be characterized by a permutation of the schools. If you can only apply to one
            college, you should apply to the first school in that permutation; if you can 
            apply to two colleges, you should apply to the first two, and so on.
        </p>

        <p>
            Mulberry takes your admissions probabilities and utility evaluations and 
            outputs this permutation. The underlying algorithm is described in my
            <a href="https://github.com/maxkapur/CollegeApplication">MS thesis</a>.
