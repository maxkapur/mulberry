        <!-- <h2>Introduction</h2> -->

        <p>
            Applying to college is kinda hard. You have to figure out which schools you like,
            as well as which schools you actually have a good chance of
            getting into. That‚Äôs the <strong>informational problem.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            Once you have this information, it‚Äôs tough to decide how to allocate
            your limited applications across desirable, competitive ‚Äúreach schools‚Äù
            and less attractive ‚Äúsafety schools‚Äù where admissions is a safer bet.
            That‚Äôs the <strong>strategic problem.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            There are boatloads of ‚Äúchance me!‚Äù websites that can help you with
            the informational problem. But when it comes to the strategic problem,
            research shows that people often resort to folk wisdom,
            risk-averse heuristics, and gut feelings.
            <strong>Mulberry treats the strategic problem as a math problem.</strong> It
            complements those introspective techniques with dispassionate, numbers-driven advice.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Mulberry is an algorithm.</strong> You input estimates of your admissions
            chances at each school and the amount of utility you associate with going there,
            and Mulberry sorts the schools in the order you should apply
            to them to maximize your expected utility. <a href="#what-is-utility">(‚ÄúUtility‚Äù?)</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            We‚Äôve randomly generated a few colleges to get you started.

                <p>
                    If you can only apply to <em>n</em> colleges, you should apply to the
                    first <em>n</em> colleges listed above.
                    Your expected <strong>utility</strong> with this application strategy
                    appears in the second column.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <strong>probability</strong> column gives the probability that you
                    ultimately attend the <em>i</em>th school, <em>given that</em> you apply to
                    schools 1 through <em>i.</em>
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>How does the algorithm work?</h2>
        <p>
            Your goal, in applying to college, is (probably) to maximize the utility of
            the <em>best</em> school you get into. If you apply to just one school, then
            your expected utility is its admissions probability times its utility value.
            But if you apply to many schools, your expected utility is a conditional
            probability expression that depends on whether you get into your first choice,
            your second choice, and so on.
        </p>

        <p>
            It turns out that
            <strong>
                the optimal application strategy can be characterized
                by a certain permutation (ordering) of the schools.
            </strong>
            If you can only apply to one college, you should apply to the first school
            in that permutation; if you can apply to two colleges, you should apply to
            the first two, and so on. Mulberry takes your admissions probabilities
            and utility parameters and computes this permutation.
        </p>

        <p>
            The interesting thing is that the optimal permutation is <em>not</em>
            determined by simply sorting the schools by the products of their admissions probability
            and utility values. <strong>Mathematically, we can show that ‚Äúobvious‚Äú idea is
                incorrect</strong>‚Äîit can produce
            a suboptimal result. To get the true optimum, you need to delve into
            the conditional probabilities described above, and that‚Äôs exactly what
            Mulberry does.
        </p>

        <p>
            The underlying algorithm is detailed in my
            <a href="https://github.com/maxkapur/CollegeApplication">MS thesis</a>.
            My thesis also addresses a more general form of the problem in which colleges
            have different application <em>fees</em> and you have a finite <em>budget</em>
            to spend on applications. If you want to solve instances of this harder problem,
            and are comfortable with the command line,
            check out my <a href="https://maxkapur.com/OptimalApplication.jl/dev/">Julia
                package</a>.
        </p>

        <h2 id="what-is-utility">How do I determine my utility values?</h2>

        <p>
            A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility">utility</a>
            value is a number that summarizes
            <strong>
                how much <em>you</em> like each school
                in light of your own priorities.
            </strong>
            The college‚Äôs student experience, career outcomes,
            the cost of tuition, and the graduation rate will
            all contribute to the utility value. You can consult
            the <a href="https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/">College Scorecard</a> for
            factual data about colleges and universities in the US.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once you‚Äôve read up on a target school, a good way to estimate its
            utility value is to ask yourself the following question:
            <strong>
                If letters of admission to this college were sold
                <span id="retail-outlet">at Best Buy</span>,
                how much money would I be willing to pay for one?
            </strong>
            Then, if necessary, divide your answer by some constant so you can
            fit it in the scale above.
